## Why I made this site
I created this site so that I could display my skills using Javcascript and Web APIs. While visiting this site, the user will be able to start a quick multiple choice coding quiz. As the user answers the questions, they are shown whether the answer they chose was correct or not. Once the user finishes the game, their score is given and can be logged upon the user submitting their name. The user is allowd to restart the game once finished with a click of a button. The buttons make the quiz a clean and simple, user-friendly game that is simple to traverse.  

## What I learned
While creating this project, I was able to further my understanding and usage of web APIs and javascript. I used web APIs and the DOM to create and push new elemewnts into the html that aren't initially coded. I also was able to add and remove styles and class of various elements that helped make the project more fucntional and repsonsive. I used querySelectors, classList, setAttribute, appendChild, textContent and more which helped further my grasp of using javascript in congunction with web APIs to create more responsive and interactive webpages. 

## Challenges 
I struggled with utlizing local storage to store the highscores of the users who take the quiz but after some thorough research, i was able to get a better grasp of how to utilize local storage and was able to successfully implemented it within my code.
